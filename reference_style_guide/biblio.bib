@article{Belfiore1979,
abstract = {As real world communication channels are stressed with higher data rates, intersymbol interference (ISI) becomes a dominant limiting factor. One way to combat this effect that has recently received considerable attention is the use of a decision feedback equalizer (DFE) in the receiver. The action of the DFE is to feed back a weighted sum of past decision to cancel the ISI they cause in the present signaling interval. This paper summarizes the work in this area beginning with the linear equalizer. Three performance criteria have been used to derive optimum systems; 1) minimize the noise variance under a "zero forcing" (ZF) constraint i.e., insist that all intersymbol interference is cancelled, 2) minimize the mean-square error (MMSE) between the true sample and the observed signal just prior to the decision threshold, and 3) minimize the probability of error (Min Pe). The transmitter can be fixed and the receiver optimized or one can obtain the joint optimum transmitter and receiver. The number of past decisions used in the feedback equalization can be finite or infinite. The infinite case is easier to handle analytically. In addition to reviewing the work done in the area, we show that the linear equalizer is in fact a portion of the DFE receiver and that the processing done by the DFE is exactly equivalent to the general problem of linear prediction. Other similarities in the various system structures are also shown. The effect of error propagation due to incorrect decisions is discussed, and the coaxial cable channel is used as an example to demonstrate the improvement available using DFE.},

@article{Cioffi1995,
abstract = {The minimum mean-squared-error decision-feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) has properties that suggest that it is a canonical equalization structure for systems that combine equalization with coded modulation. The structure and performance of the MMSE-DFE are succinctly derived using linear-estimation-theoretic principles in this first part of this two-part paper. The front-end of the MMSE-DFE, called the “mean-square whitened matched filter” (MS-WMF), is preferable in some ways to a matched filter or a whitened matched filter as a canonical receiver front end. In a coded system, the feedback filter of the MMSE-DFE may be implemented in the transmitter using precoding. The MMSE-DFE can perform significantly better than a zero-forcing decision-feedback equalizer, particularly at moderate-to-low SNR's and on severe-ISI channels. The MMSE-DFE is biased. The optimum unbiased MMSE-DFE is the MMSE-DFE with the bias removed. Removing bias improves error probability, but reduces the SNR to SNRMMSE-DFE,U=SNRMMSE-DFE-1. It is shown that this SNR relationship is a particular case of a very general result and that SNRMMSE-DFE,U gives a more realistic estimate of SNR. The results are extended to partial response equalization and to equalization with correlated inputs in an appendix},
